excerpt: 'Perfectionism rises by 33%, burnout increases tenfold, we optimize ourselves into collapse. But why? Because we are ashamed – of our fallibility, our bodies, our humanity. School and work have trained us to become machines. And now, where real machines arrive that can do everything better, the question arises: What remains of us? Part 1 about the roots of our becoming-machine – and why even world stars like Robbie Williams thought in front of 80,000 fans: "They will find me out any moment."'

## The Observation

Something has become clear to me that I can no longer unsee: Most people around me are trying to be machines. There are exceptions, but they are rare. And I belong to them - I wanted that too. I still want it, on some days.

This is not a metaphor. I mean this literally. In the way people speak about themselves - as if they were systems that need to be debugged. Working through plans, one after another, chasing a goal: perfection. And it is getting worse: A study by Curran and Hill from 2019 shows that perfectionism in young people has increased by 33% since 1989. An entire generation learning to be valuable only when they function flawlessly.

One sees it everywhere. People move away from the raw, the fleshy, the feeling. Toward clean, perfect, controlled. Everything is smoothed out. Flaws are removed from the body. Bodies like statues, not a hair in the wrong place. Poreless skin. Faces without history - no laugh lines, no traces of grief or age. Aesthetic surgeries continue to increase – in 2022 they rose by 15% compared to the previous year in Germany, particularly strongly among those under 30. Some might do it out of self-love. But mostly it is the attempt to patch from the outside what is broken inside.

Yet even when someone acts from genuine self-worth - the prevailing culture makes it increasingly difficult to recognize the difference. Morning routines that run like algorithms. Eight glasses of water, ten minutes of meditation, tracking macros, counting steps. People show their polished lives in perfect light - but only the part that functions. The human - the raw, the unpredictable, the failure - rarely comes to light. And when it does, then only calculated. Vulnerability as content. Tears with filter.

Or the gym. A machine room full of machines training on machines. Everyone with headphones, no one looks into each other's eyes. No hello, no goodbye - and when they do, everyone is surprised. We have succeeded in removing almost everything human from this place. Even the sweat - it is meticulously wiped away with disinfectant wipes, immediately, as if it were a malfunction, a leak in the system. Of course it is good to care for the body. But we maintain it like a device, we do not feel it as home. The goal is not vitality. The goal is to look like the renderings on Instagram. We externalize our self-worth and lose ourselves in the process.

The question is no longer "How do I feel?" but "How do I function?" How far am I from the perfect machine? What can I still optimize? How do I get to money fastest? The global market for self-optimization apps and productivity tools is estimated at over 13 billion dollars in 2025. We pay to become more efficient.

What I have only now understood: This is not an individual quirk. It is a pattern. A collective evasion. Psychology calls it chronic shame dissociation - outwardly a perfect self functions, inwardly emotional numbness reigns. People describe it as "wrapped in cotton wool" or "inwardly dead, but outwardly perfect."

We become what we strive for: functional zombies. David Chalmers called this the "philosophical zombie": A being that behaves exactly like a human, laughs and works, but has no consciousness. No inner experiential world. Only function. That is the logical end of our striving for flawlessness: perfect on the outside, empty on the inside. Machines with human shell.

That sounds abstract. But it is bitterly concrete. And it is no accident. It is a protective mechanism.

## The Systems

![Institutions as production systems for functioning humans.](/images/mm01-systeme.jpg)

This protective mechanism had helpers. Systems that taught us to be machines.

Our schools - the regular schools at least - are places where the body is trained out of us. Sitting still when everything wants to run. Silence when everything wants to scream. Six hours motionless on a chair while the body screams: "I am alive!" What is taught: memorize facts, function according to norm, measure performance by output. What is not taught: feeling. Sensing. Intuition. Relationship. The systematic dissociation from one's own body begins here. At six years old.

And now the bitter punchline: Almost everything these schools teach us, AI can already do better. School has prepared us for a world that is just disappearing.

The work world is no different. Everything based on logic, pattern recognition, and efficiency - thus everything we were proud of - the machine can do better. Programming. Accounting. Medical diagnosis. Legal research. Urban planning. Financial consulting. The list is long, and it is getting longer. Surgical robots will operate more precisely than any human hand. AI will design more complex laws because it keeps thousands of precedents in view simultaneously. AI interpreters know no fatigue, lose no nuances.

What remains? What can AI not do?

That where biological resonance counts. Where one nervous system calms another. Where presence cannot be simulated.

![Human resonance between two persons](/images/mm01-resonanz.jpg)

Osteopathy. Massage. Breathwork. Midwives. End-of-life care. Trauma therapy - where the nervous system of the therapist co-regulates that of the client. Real coaching, not tips, but relationship. Improvised music. Dance. Mediation, where human presence resolves conflicts. That is the common denominator: It is about bodies that sense other bodies. About nervous systems that mutually regulate each other. No AI can do that. That is the only place where we are irreplaceable.

The list is frighteningly short. Frightening when one thinks about how many people will lose their jobs in the next 10 years. How many of these people are good at feeling? And how many do we even need for these professions?

Here is the bitter irony: We have trained since industrialization - over 250 years - to be poor machines. We have suppressed the human, as well as we could. Efficiency, logic, pattern recognition - we have defined that as desirable. And now we have built real machines that can do exactly that much better.

We are obsolete machines in human bodies, in which the light is collectively slowly going out.

But one rebels against it - and massively: Our body itself.

Autoimmune diseases have risen by 22 percent between 2012 and 2022. The body attacks itself because it no longer knows who is friend and who is foe. Burnout-related sick days have more than increased tenfold since 2005. Depression and anxiety disorders are among the most common mental illnesses - the WHO designates them as the second largest cause of disability worldwide. Chronic exhaustion, Long-COVID, fibromyalgia - diseases where the nervous system simply capitulates. The body says: "I refuse." It forces the machine to standstill.

What looks like depression, burnout, or apathy is often frozen shame. The body rebels against what we have done to it: the systematic splitting off from feeling, the subjugation under machine logic.

We sit between chairs: too human to be perfect machines. Too machine-like to still know how being human goes.

But why? Why do people want to be like machines? What is so unbearable about being human that we have collectively tried to get rid of it?

The answer is simple and shattering at the same time. The psychologist Prof. Ashok Riehm brings it to the point: We flee into the machine in order not to have to feel. The reason is shame.

## The Root

Shame is not simply an unpleasant feeling. Shame is the conviction: I am wrong as I am. Not "I have made a mistake" – but "I AM the mistake."

![Inner shame as invisible space of social constriction.](/images/mm01-scham.jpg)

It begins early. A child comes into the world and is alive. It cries when it is hungry. It weeps when it needs closeness. It shows its feelings and needs raw, needy, chaotic, unfiltered. And when the answer to this is not satisfaction but rejection – "Be quiet," "Don't make such a fuss," "You are too much" – then the child does not learn self-efficacy, which represents the foundation of self-worth. Rather it learns: I am not loved as I am.

Parents who are themselves stuck in their own egos and unhealed wounds are often only occupied with enduring and regulating their children's feelings – anger, impatience, silliness, fears. And when these children are also neurodivergent – which has been diagnosed significantly more frequently in recent years, partly through better recognition, partly possibly through changed living conditions – then it is overwhelming.

These parents cannot see the true core, the spirit of their children. They cannot mirror it before the child becomes aware of itself. Instead they project their own wounds onto the child, day in, day out. And the child begins to develop its personality not from within itself, but through adaptation. It scans the expectations, the wishes, the unspoken rules of its parents. It builds itself around these. It leads away from one's own core. And this process itself generates a deep shame: The shame of not being allowed to be oneself. Because the child knows exactly – would it show its true self, it would no longer be enough for its parents. But it cannot afford that. It is dependent. So it splits off.

The child locks in everything that must not be: the anger, the sadness, the fear, the need. It packs these feelings deep into the body. There, where no one sees them. And exactly there lies the wound – wrapped in shame.

The child cannot think: "The adults are overwhelmed." It thinks: "I am wrong." And in order to survive, it cuts itself off from the feeling. The body becomes the enemy – because it is the carrier of shame, because it makes visible what must remain hidden. Visibility becomes danger. Vulnerability becomes weakness.

Prof. Ashok Riehm, psychologist and trauma researcher, brings it to the point: "I was not shamed, I became shame." The child merges with the shame. It becomes what was done to it.

And then comes the machine. The machine promises redemption. The machine has no needs. The machine is not rejected. The machine functions – and when it functions, it is valuable. Whoever is lucky, whose nervous system happens to fit the requirements, becomes dependent on performance. Performance gives back a value. But it is borrowed value. Value on credit. As long as the machine runs, the child – later the adult – feels valuable. As soon as it falters, everything collapses. Because underneath there is nothing. No foundation. Only the old certainty: I am wrong.

And exactly this inner emptiness is the perfect fuel for what we have built: a capitalism that lives from us never being enough, and a narcissism that polishes the grandiose false self outward while shame reigns inside. The systems – schools, offices, gyms – do not even have to force us. Our own shame drives us. We buy products to close the wound. We optimize bodies to become valuable. We chase careers to prove that we are right after all. The system profits exactly from this. It needs people who are not enough for themselves. People who believe they must earn their worth.

The dissociation from the body, from feeling, from the human is not a defect. It is a protective mechanism. It is survival.

But this is not only an individual story. There is also a cultural license for it.

René Descartes made the cut in the 17th century at which we still bleed today. He separated body and mind. The body: matter, an automaton, a clockwork of flesh. The mind: the only valuable thing, the divine in us. Descartes wanted to save the soul, give it a safe place, far from perishable matter.

But we have taken from his philosophy only what we needed. The permission to treat the body as a machine – we have gratefully accepted that. The divine mind? We have struck that out. It was inconvenient. It would have meant that there is still something sacred, something worth protecting. So we simply declared it irrelevant. What remained: mechanics. Flesh that functions. Without consciousness, without sanctity, without dignity.

That was the perfect invitation for industrialization. If the body is only material, only an object, then one may treat it like a tool. One may exploit it, optimize it, trim it for efficiency. Sensing becomes a disturbance in operations. Fatigue becomes malfunction. Pain becomes a technical problem.

The body becomes labor power. Measurable, exchangeable, optimizable. Efficiency becomes the highest value.

Individual shame and cultural devaluation of the body reinforce each other. What begins as personal protective mechanism becomes social norm. We all learn: The human is the problem. The machine is the solution.

And exactly here happens the actual theft. When we pathologize aliveness and reward adaptation, we rob ourselves and our children of something fundamental: dignity. We read Article 1 of the Basic Law: "Human dignity is inviolable." A beautiful sentence. But in a culture of machines it is an illusion. We have long touched dignity. We trample it daily, without wanting to. We alienate ourselves from the human, from sensing. And in order not to have to feel this loss, we finally become machines. Because machines need no dignity. Objects need no dignity. They only need maintenance.

## The Tragedy

You can optimize yourself as much as you want. You can have the perfect body, the perfect career, the perfect life. You can do everything right. And still – the feeling remains. I am wrong.

It is the paradoxical law of becoming-machine: The more perfectly you function outwardly, the stronger the fear becomes inside. Impostor syndrome is not modesty. It is the logical consequence. Robbie Williams, one of the most successful entertainers in the world, describes it thus: Even in front of 80,000 people he thought: "I will be found out any moment. Any moment they will notice that I actually cannot do anything. That it is all just bluff." Decades of success. Millions of fans. And yet the panicked fear: If they knew who I really am, it would all be over.

This is not a celebrity problem. We all do it. We seek confirmation for our machine-being. We consume it. We want to be praised for our clothes, our job, our vacation, our body. We post it on Instagram, we display it. We build a simulated self-worth that only exists as long as someone from outside applauds. We externalize our self. We outsource our worth.

But the applause always lands only on the facade. It applies to the machine, not to the human inside. And therefore it heals nothing. Deep inside still waits the wounded child. It hopes for rescue. It still hopes – even in adulthood – that the parents (or the world) will finally save one, finally see, finally love. The cruel irony is: We hope to be loved for what we really are. But we show the world only what we believe we must be. We have adapted ourselves so much, functioned so perfectly, that we no longer even know who we actually are. We have lost contact with what actually screams inside.

That generates an unbearable inner friction. It tears one apart. There is a longing that is not satisfied, no matter how perfectly the machine runs. Because what we really need cannot be obtained through performance. The machine runs hot. The fans turn to maximum. We have perfected ourselves – and lost ourselves in the process.

Maintaining the machine will not save us. Now that real machines are here, we can no longer suppress the question: What remains when the copy becomes obsolete? How we reclaim our dignity – and what AI has to do with it – that is what Part 2 is about.
